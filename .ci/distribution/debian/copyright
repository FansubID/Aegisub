 NOTE: A special thanks and credit goes to Geoff Kuenning
 the creator of ispell.  MySpell's affix algorithms were
 based on those of ispell which should be noted is
 copyright Geoff Kuenning et.al. and now available
 under a BSD style license. For more information on ispell
 and affix compression in general, please see:
 http://www.cs.ucla.edu/ficus-members/geoff/ispell.html
 (the home page for ispell)
 .
 An almost complete rewrite  of MySpell for use by
 the Mozilla project has been developed by David Einstein
 (Deinst@world.std.com).  David and I are now
 working on parallel development tracks to help
 our respective projects (Mozilla and OpenOffice.org
 and we will maintain full affix file and dictionary
 file compatibility and work on merging our versions
 of MySpell back into a single tree. David has been
 a significant help in improving MySpell.
 .
 Special thanks also go to La'szlo' Ne'meth
 <nemethl@gyorsposta.hu> who is the author of the
 Hungarian dictionary and who developed and contributed
 the code to support compound words in MySpell
 and fixed numerous problems with the encoding
 case conversion tables.

 The non-unix version of ftsystem.c uses stdio functions, but freetype uses
 streams as if they had mmap's performance characteristics (as it uses mmap
 on unix), which results in mind-blowingly poor performance (35%+ of the
 fontconfig caching runtime is spent on fseek).

 CP949 is EUC-KR, extended with UHC (Unified Hangul Code).

 Some variants of CP949 (in JDK, Windows-2000, ICU) also add:

 .
 code           Unicode
 0xC9{A1..FE}   U+E000..U+E05D
 0xFE{A1..FE}   U+E05E..U+E0BB
 .
 We add them too because, although there are backward compatibility problems
 when a character from a private area is moved to an official Unicode code
 point, they are useful for some people in practice.

 Specification: Unicode 3.1 Standard Annex #19
 .
 Here we accept FFFE0000/0000FEFF marks as endianness indicators
 everywhere in the stream, not just at the beginning. (This is contrary
 to what #19 D36c specifies, but it allows concatenation of byte
 sequences to work flawlessly, while disagreeing with #19 behaviour
 only for strings containing U+FEFF characters, which is quite rare.)
 The default is big-endian.
 The state is 0 if big-endian, 1 if little-endian.

 BIG5-2003
 .
 BIG5-2003 is a slightly extended and slightly modified version of BIG5.
 It is actually nearer to Microsoft CP950 than to BIG5. The differences
 between EASTASIA/OTHER/BIG5.TXT found on ftp.unicode.org and BIG5-2003.TXT
 are as follows:
 .
 1. Some characters in the symbols area (0xA140..0xA2CE) are defined
 differently:
 .
 code   BIG5.TXT                       BIG5-2003.TXT
 0xA145  0x2022 # BULLET                0x2027 # HYPHENATION POINT
 0xA14E  0xFF64 # HALFWIDTH IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA
 0xFE51 # SMALL IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA
 0xA156  0x2013 # EN DASH               0x2015 # HORIZONTAL BAR
 0xA15A    ---                          0x2574 # BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT LEFT
 0xA1C3    ---                          0xFFE3 # FULLWIDTH MACRON
 0xA1C5    ---                          0x02CD # MODIFIER LETTER LOW MACRON
 0xA1E3  0x223C # TILDE OPERATOR        0xFF5E # FULLWIDTH TILDE
 0xA1F2  0x2641 # EARTH                 0x2295 # CIRCLED PLUS
 0xA1F3  0x2609 # SUN                   0x2299 # CIRCLED DOT OPERATOR
 0xA1FE    ---                          0xFF0F # FULLWIDTH SOLIDUS
 0xA240    ---                          0xFF3C # FULLWIDTH REVERSE SOLIDUS
 0xA241  0xFF0F # FULLWIDTH SOLIDUS     0x2215 # DIVISION SLASH
 0xA242  0xFF3C # FULLWIDTH REVERSE SOLIDUS
 0xFE68 # SMALL REVERSE SOLIDUS
 0xA244  0x00A5 # YEN SIGN              0xFFE5 # FULLWIDTH YEN SIGN
 0xA246  0x00A2 # CENT SIGN             0xFFE0 # FULLWIDTH CENT SIGN
 0xA247  0x00A3 # POUND SIGN            0xFFE1 # FULLWIDTH POUND SIGN
 0xA2A4  0x2550 # BOX DRAWINGS DOUBLE HORIZONTAL
 0x2501 # BOX DRAWINGS HEAVY HORIZONTAL
 0xA2A5  0x255E # BOX DRAWINGS VERTICAL SINGLE AND RIGHT DOUBLE
 0x251D # BOX DRAWINGS VERTICAL LIGHT AND RIGHT HEAVY
 0xA2A6  0x256A # BOX DRAWINGS VERTICAL SINGLE AND HORIZONTAL DOUBLE
 0x253F # BOX DRAWINGS VERTICAL LIGHT AND HORIZONTAL HEAVY
 0xA2A7  0x2561 # BOX DRAWINGS VERTICAL SINGLE AND LEFT DOUBLE
 0x2525 # BOX DRAWINGS VERTICAL LIGHT AND LEFT HEAVY
 0xA2CC    ---                          0x3038 # HANGZHOU NUMERAL TEN
 0xA2CD  0x5344                         0x3039 # HANGZHOU NUMERAL TWENTY
 0xA2CE    ---                          0x303A # HANGZHOU NUMERAL THIRTY
 .
 2. A control symbols area is added:
 .
 code
 0xA3C0..0xA3E0  U+2400..U+2421
 .
 3. The Euro sign is added:
 .
 code
 0xA3E1  0x20AC # EURO SIGN
 .
 4. Some characters in the main area are defined differently:
 .
 code   BIG5.TXT                       BIG5-2003.TXT
 0xC255  0x5F5D                         0x5F5E
 .
 5. The area 0xC6A1..0xC7FE is organized differently:
 .
 code
 0xC6A1..0xC6BE  numerals (was in BIG5.TXT at 0xC7E9..0xC7FC)
 0xC6BF..0xC6D7  radicals
 0xC6D8..0xC6E6  rarely used symbols
 0xC6E7..0xC77A  hiragana (U+3041..U+3093, was in BIG5.TXT at 0xC6A5..0xC6F7)
 0xC77B..0xC7F2  katakana (U+30A1..U+30F6, was in BIG5.TXT at 0xC6F8..0xC7B0)
 .
 6. Some characters are added at 0xF9D6..0xF9DC.
 .
 7. Box drawing characters are added at 0xF9DD..0xF9FE.
 .
 Note: 4 of these characters are mapped in a non-inversible way, because
 Unicode does not yet include the corresponding characters:
 .
 code                                           Unicode approximation
 0xF9FA  BOX DRAWINGS DOUBLE ARC DOWN AND RIGHT  0x2554
 0xF9FB  BOX DRAWINGS DOUBLE ARC DOWN AND LEFT   0x2557
 0xF9FC  BOX DRAWINGS DOUBLE ARC UP AND RIGHT    0x255A
 0xF9FD  BOX DRAWINGS DOUBLE ARC UP AND LEFT     0x255D
 .
 8. Private area mappings are added:
 .
 code                 Unicode
 0x{81..8D}{40..7E,A1..FE}  U+EEB8..U+F6B0
 0x{8E..A0}{40..7E,A1..FE}  U+E311..U+EEB7
 0x{FA..FE}{40..7E,A1..FE}  U+E000..U+E310
 .
 These mappings are not contained in the BSMI Big5-2003 standard. However,
 they were contained in a draft of it.

 .
 2. A small new row. See cp950ext.h.
 .
 3. CP950.TXT is lacking the range 0xC6A1..0xC7FC (Hiragana, Katakana,
 Cyrillic, circled digits, parenthesized digits).
 .
 We implement this omission, because said range is marked "uncertain"
 in the unicode.org BIG5 table.
 .
 The table found on Microsoft's website furthermore adds:
 .
 4. A single character:
 .
 code   CP950.TXT
 0xA3E1  0x20AC # EURO SIGN
 .
 Many variants of BIG5 or CP950 (in JDK, Solaris, OSF/1, Windows-2000, ICU,
 as well as our BIG5-2003 converter) also add:
 .
 5. Private area mappings:
 .
 code                 Unicode
 0x{81..8D}{40..7E,A1..FE}  U+EEB8..U+F6B0
 0x{8E..A0}{40..7E,A1..FE}  U+E311..U+EEB7
 0x{FA..FE}{40..7E,A1..FE}  U+E000..U+E310
 .
 We add them too because, although there are backward compatibility problems
 when a character from a private area is moved to an official Unicode code
 point, they are useful for some people in practice.

 GBK
 .
 GBK, as described in Ken Lunde's book, is an extension of GB 2312-1980
 (shifted by adding 0x8080 to the range 0xA1A1..0xFEFE, as used in EUC-CN).
 It adds the following ranges:
 .
 (part of GBK/1)  0xA2A1-0xA2AA  Small Roman numerals
 GBK/3   0x{81-A0}{40-7E,80-FE}  6080 new characters, all in Unicode
 GBK/4   0x{AA-FE}{40-7E,80-A0}  8160 new characters, 8080 in Unicode
 GBK/5   0x{A8-A9}{40-7E,80-A0}  166 new characters, 153 in Unicode
 .
 Furthermore, all four tables I have looked at
 - the CP936 table by Microsoft, found on ftp.unicode.org in 1999,
 - the GBK table by Sun, investigated on a Solaris 2.7 machine,
 - the GBK tables by CWEX, found in the Big5+ package,
 - the GB18030 standard (second printing),
 agree in the following extensions. (Ken Lunde must have overlooked these
 differences between GB2312 and GBK. Also, the CWEX tables have additional
 differences.)
 .
 1. Some characters in the GB2312 range are defined differently:
 .
 code    GB2312                         GBK
 0xA1A4   0x30FB # KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT   0x00B7 # MIDDLE DOT
 0xA1AA   0x2015 # HORIZONTAL BAR        0x2014 # EM DASH
 .
 2. 19 characters added in the range 0xA6E0-0xA6F5.
 .
 3. 4 characters added in the range 0xA8BB-0xA8C0.
 .
 CP936 as of 1999 was identical to GBK. However, since 1999, Microsoft has
 added new mappings to CP936...

 CP936
 .
 The IANA has CP936 as an alias of GBK. But GBK is an official Chinese
 specification, whereas CP936 is de-facto maintained by Microsoft. And,
 of course, Microsoft modified CP936 since 1999.
 .
 The differences from GBK are:
 .
 1. A single character:
 .
 code   CP936.TXT
 0x80   0x20AC # EURO SIGN
 .
 Some variants of CP936 (in JDK, Windows-2000, ICU) also add:
 .
 2. Private area mappings:
 .
 code                 Unicode
 0x{A1..A2}{40..7E,80..A0}  U+E4C6..U+E585
 0x{AA..AF,F8..FE}{A1..FE}  U+E000..U+E4C5
 .
 We add them too because, although there are backward compatibility problems
 when a character from a private area is moved to an official Unicode code
 point, they are useful for some people in practice.

 GB18030
 .
 GB18030, as specified in the GB18030 standard, is an extension of GBK.
 .
 In what follows, page numbers refer to the GB18030 standard (second
 printing).
 .
 It consists of the following parts:

 JOHAB Hangul
 .
 Ken Lunde writes in his "CJKV Information Processing" book, p. 114:
 "Hangul can be composed of two or three jamo (some jamo are considered
 compound). Johab uses 19 initial jamo (consonants), 21 medial jamo (vowels)
 and 27 final jamo (consonants; 28 when you include the "fill" character
 for Hangul containing only two jamo). Multiplying these numbers results in
 11172."

 ISO-IR-165
 .
 ISO-IR-165 is an extension of GB 2312, consisting of:
 1. GB 6345.1-86 corrections:
 Two corrections to GB 2312, at 0x2367 and 0x6F71.
 2. GB 6345.1-86 additions:
 - 6 new full-width pinyin characters in row 0x28.
 - ISO646-CN in row 0x2A.
 - 32 half-width pinyin characters in row 0x2B.
 3. GB 8565.2-88 additions:
 - 50 characters in row 0x2D.
 - 92 characters in row 0x2E.
 - 93 characters in row 0x2F.
 - 470 characters in rows 0x7A-0x7E.
 4. ISO-IR-165 additions:
 - 22 characters in row 0x26.
 - 94 characters in row 0x2C.
 - 44 new characters in row 0x2D.
 - 1 new character in row 0x2F.
 .
 The conversion table was created from the following sources:
 Ad 1. The 0x2367 correction is already integrated in the unicode.org
 GB2312.TXT table. The 0x6F71 mapping is the same in the unicode.org
 GB2312.TXT and UNIHAN.TXT table and in Koichi Yasuoka's Uni2GB table,
 so we assume it's correct.
 The unicode.org UNIHAN.TXT table about GB 8565 is not usable: it has
 extraneous code points at rows 0x28, 0x2C, 0x2D. Note also that it does
 not list the 69 non-hanzi in row 0x2F. Moreover, it has the characters
 0x2F7A-0x2F7D shifted down by one to 0x2F79-0x2F7C.
 Therefore we take the GB8565 and ISO-IR-165 data from Koichi Yasuoka's
 Uni2GB table.
 Ad 1. Yasuoka maps 0x2367 to U+0261 (small script g) and 0x2840 to U+FF47
 (full-width small normal g). While coherent with ISO-IR's 165.pdf,
 this disagrees with Ken Lunde's book: He says that ISO-IR-165
 includes the GB6345 correction, i.e. maps 0x2367 to U+FF47 or U+0067

 Specification: RFC 2781

 Here we accept FFFE/FEFF marks as endianness indicators everywhere
 in the stream, not just at the beginning. (This is contrary to what
 RFC 2781 section 3.2 specifies, but it allows concatenation of byte
 sequences to work flawlessly, while disagreeing with the RFC behaviour
 only for strings containing U+FEFF characters, which is quite rare.)
 The default is big-endian.
 The state is 0 if big-endian, 1 if little-endian.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 .
 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
 below.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 .
 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 introduced by others.
 ^L
 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 .
 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 libraries into non-free programs.
 .
 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 the library.
 .
 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 special circumstances.
 .
 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
 becomes
 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 .
 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 system.
 .
 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 that program using a modified version of the Library.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 be combined with the library in order to run.
 ^L
 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 .
 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 .
 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
 compilation
 and installation of the library.
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 .
 b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
 c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 .
 d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.
 .
 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.
 ^L
 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 .
 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.
 .
 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 .
 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 .
 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 .
 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 .
 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 ^L
 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.
 .
 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:
 .
 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)
 .
 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 .
 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.
 .
 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.
 .
 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 .
 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 .
 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
 ^L
 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 .
 a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.
 .
 b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 .
 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 .
 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.
 ^L
 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
 countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 .
 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 ^L
 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 ^L
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 .
 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
 of the ordinary General Public License).
 .
 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
 It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
 effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
 have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
 notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it
 does.>
 Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
 This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
 version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 .
 This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
 Lesser General Public License for more details.
 .
 You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
 Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307  USA
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
 mail.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
 your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

 and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
 .
 (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
 selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
 and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
 of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
 made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
 Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
 Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
 Version (or portions of such combination).
 .
 (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
 granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
 Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
 3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
 Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
 by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
 Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
 infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
 that Contributor.
 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
 3.1. Application of License.
 The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
 governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
 Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
 distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
 of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
 copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
 distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
 version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
 License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
 an additional document offering the additional rights described in
 Section 3.5.
 .
 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
 Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
 made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
 either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
 Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
 Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
 Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
 months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
 (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
 has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
 ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
 Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
 3.3. Description of Modifications.
 You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
 file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
 the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
 the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
 Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
 Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
 Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
 origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
 (a) Third Party Claims.
 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
 intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
 granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
 Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
 distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
 party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
 know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
 the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
 Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
 Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
 (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
 reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
 Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
 (b) Contributor APIs.
 If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
 interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
 are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
 also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 .
 Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
 Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
 this License.
 .
 3.5. Required Notices.
 You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
 Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
 Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
 location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
 to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
 You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
 Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
 for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
 rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
 charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
 obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
 may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
 Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
 any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
 offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
 Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
 Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
 support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
 requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
 and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
 the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
 including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
 obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
 in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
 collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
 Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
 Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
 contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
 compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
 Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
 rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
 License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
 license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
 from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
 Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
 Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
 the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
 terms You offer.
 .
 3.7. Larger Works.
 You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
 not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
 Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
 requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
 must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
 be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
 extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
 understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
 attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
 6.1. New Versions.
 Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
 and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
 will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
 6.2. Effect of New Versions.
 Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
 License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
 version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
 of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
 other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
 Covered Code created under this License.
 .
 6.3. Derivative Works.
 If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
 only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
 governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
 the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
 "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
 license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
 and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
 contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
 Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
 Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
 Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
 this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
 COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
 DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
 IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
 YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
 COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
 OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
 ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
 8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
 such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
 sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
 survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
 nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
 shall survive.
 .
 8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
 claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
 or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
 You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
 .
 (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
 infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
 Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
 shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
 unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
 agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
 royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
 Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
 the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
 of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
 mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
 is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
 Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
 the 60 day notice period specified above.
 .
 (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
 Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
 any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
 and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
 sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
 Participant.
 .
 8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
 alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
 indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
 by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
 infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
 granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
 into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
 license.
 .
 8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
 all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
 which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
 prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
 (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
 DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
 OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
 ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
 CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
 WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
 COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
 INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
 LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
 RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
 PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
 THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
 The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
 software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
 terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
 all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
 rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
 necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
 California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
 any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
 With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
 or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
 States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
 subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
 District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
 California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
 without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
 expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
 Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
 Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
 shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
 License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
 responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
 out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
 work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
 responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
 shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 .
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 .
 Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
 "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
 Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
 Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
 by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
 .

 This is a helper module used by the LuaJIT machine code dumper module.
 .
 Sending small code snippets to an external disassembler and mixing the
 output with our own stuff was too fragile. So I had to bite the bullet
 and write yet another x86 disassembler. Oh well ...
 .
 The output format is very similar to what ndisasm generates. But it has
 been developed independently by looking at the opcode tables from the
 Intel and AMD manuals. The supported instruction set is quite extensive
 and reflects what a current generation Intel or AMD CPU implements in
 32 bit and 64 bit mode. Yes, this includes MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3,
 SSE4.1, SSE4.2, SSE4a and even privileged and hypervisor (VMX/SVM)
 instructions.
 .
 Notes:
 * The (useless) a16 prefix, 3DNow and pre-586 opcodes are unsupported.
 * No attempt at optimization has been made -- it's fast enough for my needs.
 * The public API may change when more architectures are added.
